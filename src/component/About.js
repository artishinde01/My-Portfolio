              Java was originally designed for interactive television, but it
              was too advanced technology for the digital cable television
              industry at the time. The history of Java starts with the Green
              Team. Java team members (also known as Green Team), initiated this
              project to develop a language for digital devices such as set-top
              boxes, televisions, etc. However, it was best suited for internet
              programming. Later.
